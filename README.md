# 💀 DeathBox — The Financial Afterlife Kit

> So your family never has to guess what you left behind.

DeathBox is an AI-powered financial afterlife organizer that helps users securely record, structure, and store their financial information while alive — and automatically delivers a clear, guided “Afterlife Package” to their family when needed.

Built for FinTech, AI, and Social Good hackathons, DeathBox ensures families never lose access to critical financial information during times of grief.

#  Problem

When someone dies, families often have **no idea**:

- What bank accounts exist  
- Where life insurance policies are stored  
- How to access 401k or employer benefits  
- What debts or subscriptions are active  
- Whether unused PTO or insurance benefits exist  

Families spend months just locating information.  
Meanwhile:
- Life insurance goes unclaimed  
- COBRA deadlines pass  
- Benefits are lost  
- Subscriptions keep charging  

**DeathBox prevents this.**

#  Solution

DeathBox allows users to record their financial life through simple voice or text conversations.

The system:
1. Extracts structured financial data using AI  
2. Detects missing benefits and risks  
3. Stores encrypted data securely  
4. Creates an organized “Afterlife Package”  
5. Releases it automatically via a dead-man’s switch  

Families receive:
- Urgent action checklist  
- Benefits & insurance details  
- Debt guidance  
- Subscription cancellation list  
- AI voice walkthrough
